# Session 1: Fundamentals and Initial Setup

This document covers the content for the first session, focusing on the fundamentals of unit testing, setting up a development environment, and writing your first test with xUnit.

---

## Objectives
- Understand what unit testing is and its benefits.
- Learn key concepts like the AAA pattern and code coverage.
- Set up a C# project with xUnit and Coverlet.
- Write and execute your first unit test.
- Generate a code coverage report and understand how to interpret it.

## 1. Introduction to Unit Testing

### **What is Unit Testing?**
Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of a program to ensure they work as intended. Each test should focus on a single unit of work, such as a method or function, to verify its correctness under various conditions.

#### **Key Benefits**
- **Early Error Detection:**
  - Unit tests allow developers to catch bugs during the development phase, saving time and reducing costs associated with fixing issues later in the project lifecycle.
  - Example: Detecting a null pointer exception in a method before integrating it into a larger system.

- **Code Maintenance:**
  - Tests act as a safety net, enabling developers to refactor code confidently, knowing existing functionality remains intact.
  - Example: Updating a method to improve performance without worrying about introducing new bugs.

- **Improved Code Quality:**
  - Writing tests encourages developers to structure code in smaller, reusable, and testable components.
  - Example: Separating business logic from database operations for better modularity.

#### **Comparison with Other Types of Testing**
- **Unit Testing:** Focuses on verifying the functionality of a single method or function in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensures that multiple components or systems work together as expected.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulates real-world scenarios to validate the entire system's workflow.

## 2. Key Concepts

### **1. Mocks and Stubs**
- **Mocks:**
  - Mocks simulate the behavior of external dependencies, such as databases or APIs, allowing you to test components independently.
  - Example: Mocking a database query to return predefined data during a test.

- **Stubs:**
  - Stubs provide hardcoded data for testing purposes, reducing dependency on external systems.
  - Example: Using a stub to simulate a file read operation.

### **2. AAA Pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)**
- **Arrange:**
  - Prepare the necessary data and configure the conditions for the test.
  - Example: Initializing objects or setting up mock dependencies.

- **Act:**
  - Execute the method or functionality being tested.
  - Example: Calling a method with specific input parameters.

- **Assert:**
  - Verify that the output or behavior meets the expected result.
  - Example: Using assertions like `Assert.Equal(expected, actual)` to compare values.

### **3. Code Coverage**
- **Definition:** Measures the percentage of code executed during testing.
- **Importance:**
  - Highlights untested areas of the codebase.
  - Helps ensure critical paths are thoroughly tested.

### **4. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Cycle**
- **Red:**
  - Write a test that fails because the functionality is not yet implemented.
  - Example: Writing a test for a method that does not yet exist.

- **Green:**
  - Write minimal code to make the test pass.
  - Example: Implementing a basic version of the method to satisfy the test.

- **Refactor:**
  - Improve the code structure while ensuring all tests still pass.
  - Example: Simplifying logic or removing duplication.
